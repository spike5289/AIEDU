    "### Why Use Virtual Environments?\n",
    "\n",
    "When you work on different Python projects, you'll often find that they have different dependencies. Project A might need version 1.0 of a library, while Project B needs version 2.0 of the same library.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you install these dependencies globally, you'll run into conflicts. A **virtual environment** solves this by creating an isolated directory for each project, with its own Python interpreter and installed packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Benefits:**\n",
    "- **Isolation:** Avoids dependency conflicts between projects.\n",
    "- **Reproducibility:** Makes it easy to recreate the exact environment on another machine.\n",
    "- **Cleanliness:** Keeps your global `site-packages` directory clean.\n"

    "- **Standards-Compliant:** It uses modern `pyproject.toml` for project configuration (PEP 621).\n",

    "\n",
    "In it, you define your project's metadata (name, version) and its dependencies. `uv` automatically adds new packages here when you run `uv add`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example `[project]` section in `pyproject.toml`:**\n",
    "```toml\n",
    "[project]\n",
    "name = \"my-ai-project\"\n",
    "version = \"0.1.0\"\n",
    "dependencies = [\n",
    "    \"numpy\",\n",
    "    \"pandas\",\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `uv.lock`\n",
    "This is a **lock file**. While `pyproject.toml` might say you need `numpy`, the lock file specifies the *exact* version (e.g., `numpy==1.26.4`) and all of its sub-dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key benefits of a lock file:**\n",
    "- **Deterministic Builds:** Everyone on your team gets the exact same versions of all packages, every time. This guarantees reproducibility across machines and time.\n",
    "- **Cross-Platform:** `uv.lock` is designed to work across different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).\n",
    "- **Security:** It includes hashes of the packages to ensure the code you install hasn't been tampered with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `uv` with `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` is the modern standard for robust, reproducible, and fast Python development.\n"
